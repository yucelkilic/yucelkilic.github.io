Hello! I'm Dr. Yücel Kılıç, a planetary scientist at the [TÜBİTAK National Observatory](https://tug.tubitak.gov.tr) (TUG) in Antalya, Türkiye. Using the stellar occultation technique, I study small celestial bodies in our Solar System. I'm particularly fascinated by TNOs and Centaurs, which are distant objects in the Solar System. As the technical group leader of the telescopes at TUG, I am responsible for ensuring the sustainability of our robotic telescope's software and scientific infrastructure. I am also the web developer for the [Occultation Portal](https://occuştation.tug.tubitak.gov.tr) which is an archive and analysis platform for the [ERC Lucky Star Project](https://lesia.obspm.fr/lucky-star/).
